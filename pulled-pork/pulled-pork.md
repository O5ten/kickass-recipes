Put the spices on the tenderloin and put it in a oven secure form and place 
it in 70-80*c for 10-12 hours for best effect. 

##When done
Get the meat out of the pot and set aside.
It will be alot of fluids so use a strainer and a clean pot and pour the fluids and onions into, 
anything caught in the strainer gets thrown out and the fluids will be saved for later.
Take 2 forks and shred the meat.

when adding the fluids again go easy and use a table spoon. 
Add a little juice then stir the meat and repeat until desired juicyness is accomplished.

- If you want to *serve* it now pour much sauce on the pulled pork.
- If you want to *freeze* it don't pour less sauce on the pulled pork. 

Save the additional sauce for later.
